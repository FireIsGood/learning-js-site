            have been arrested for various charges, but only one is guilty. The
            jury can only convict everyone or no one and their decision must be
            made beforehand based on the total charges. How is the jury to be
            most just in this harrowing scenario?

        I'm a cool card that starts out here! Wow look at me go aw yeah! I also
        have enough text to fill the box and test text wrap or something like

        replacement card so it's easier to see the difference
