      <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

      <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been
        adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the
        years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle
        Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta
        breads.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>
          Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
        </li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
            </li>
            <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of
        lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint,
        or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Storage</h2>

      <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be
        able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to
        become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a
        couple of months.

      <h1>Important notice</h1>
      <p>
        On Sunday January 9th 2010, a <em>gang of goths</em> were spotted
        stealing <strong>several garden gnomes</strong> from a shopping center
        in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all wearing
        <em>green jumpsuits</em> and <em>silly hats</em>, and seemed to be
        having a whale of a time.
